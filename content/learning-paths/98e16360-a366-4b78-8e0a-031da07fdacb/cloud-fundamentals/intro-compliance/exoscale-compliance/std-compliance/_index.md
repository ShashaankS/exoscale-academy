### Framework

#### ISO 27001

*Information Security Management specifies a set of requirements that helps organizations manage their assets' security.*

ISO 27001 is a globally recognized standard for information security management. It provides a framework for managing and protecting sensitive information assets like customer data, financial information, and intellectual property. The standard outlines a systematic approach to managing information security risks, including risk assessment, risk treatment, and continuous monitoring and improvement. Organizations that implement ISO 27001 can demonstrate to customers, partners, and regulators that they have a robust information security management system in place. The standard covers many security controls, including physical security, access controls, network security, and incident management.

#### ISO 27017

*Information Security Controls for cloud services is a code of practice that provides guidelines on managing information security controls.*

ISO 27017 is a standard that provides guidelines for cloud service providers on implementing adequate information security controls in their cloud environments. The standard is based on ISO 27001, which provides a framework for information security management, but it also includes additional rules and guidelines specific to cloud computing.

ISO 27017 covers a range of essential security controls for cloud service providers, including data segregation, access control, encryption, logging and monitoring, and incident management. It also includes guidance on managing risks related to third-party cloud services, such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers.

By implementing ISO 27017, cloud service providers can demonstrate to their customers that they have implemented adequate security controls to protect their data and systems in the cloud. It can also help cloud service providers comply with regulatory requirements related to data protection and privacy.

#### ISO 27018

*Personally Identifiable Information (PII) protection is a code of practice that helps secure PII for the public cloud computing environment.*

ISO 27018 is a standard that provides guidelines for protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in public cloud environments. It is based on ISO 27001, which provides a framework for information security management, but it also includes additional controls and guidelines specific to protecting PII in the cloud.

ISO 27018 covers a range of security controls necessary for cloud service providers, including data protection, retention, portability, and transparency. It also includes guidance on managing risks related to third-party cloud services, such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers.

By implementing ISO 27018, cloud service providers can demonstrate to their customers that they have implemented adequate security controls to protect their PII in the cloud. It can also help cloud service providers comply with regulatory requirements related to data protection and privacy, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

#### SOC 2

*Design, implement, and operate controls to meet security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy objectives.*

SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) is an audit report that assures the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a service organization's systems and data. It is conducted by an independent auditor based on the Trust Services Criteria established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

SOC 2 audits evaluate a service organization's data security and privacy controls, including physical and logical access controls, network security, system monitoring and alerting, data backup and recovery, and incident management. The audit also assesses the effectiveness of the organization's policies and procedures related to data management, including data classification, retention, and disposal.

The SOC 2 report provides a detailed description of the service organization's controls and includes an opinion from the auditor on the effectiveness of those controls. Service organizations often use it to demonstrate to their customers that they have implemented adequate security and privacy controls and to provide assurance that their systems and data are protected.

#### CSA STAR

*Is a third-party independent, technology-neutral assessment and certification of the security of a cloud service provider.*

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR) is a program that provides a framework for cloud service providers to demonstrate their security and compliance capabilities. The program includes a registry of cloud service providers that have completed a self-assessment or an independent audit against the CSA's Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) and Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ).

The CSA STAR program provides a comprehensive set of criteria for assessing the security and compliance of cloud service providers, including data protection, identity and access management, compliance, and risk management. It also provides tools and resources for cloud service providers to improve their security and compliance capabilities, such as CCM and CAIQ.

By participating in the CSA STAR program, cloud service providers can demonstrate to their customers and partners that they have implemented adequate security and compliance controls and have undergone an independent assessment of their security and compliance capabilities. This can increase transparency and trust in cloud services and give customers the information they need to make informed decisions about cloud service providers.

#### C5

*Is a cloud computing compliance criteria catalog (C5) to define a baseline security level for cloud computing.*

The C5 (Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalog) is a set of cloud security and compliance standards developed by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). The C5 criteria catalog provides a framework for assessing cloud service providers' security and compliance capabilities and is designed to help German government agencies and other organizations make informed decisions about cloud service providers.

The C5 criteria catalog covers a range of security and compliance controls, including data protection, access control, incident management, business continuity, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. It also includes specific requirements for cloud service providers related to data sovereignty, transparency, and auditability.

To comply with the C5 criteria catalog, cloud service providers must undergo an independent audit by a certified auditor, who evaluates the provider's security and compliance controls against the C5 criteria. The audit results are then made available to customers and partners, providing transparency and assurance about the provider's security and compliance capabilities.

The C5 criteria catalog is designed to help organizations assess cloud service providers' security and compliance capabilities and ensure that their data is protected in the cloud. It is particularly relevant for German government agencies and other organizations subject to strict data protection and security regulations.
